Describe at least:

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

- Cameron Walden: Accountability, Communication & Dependability

- Marquesa Asmussen: Creativity, Communication & Collaboration

- Steve Ngo: Strong in CSS and design web layout, graphic design, research, teamwork, work overtime, and dedication.

- Katy Roffe: Curiosity, Accountability & Organization

- Eddie Ponce: strong in CSS/layout, Bootstrap

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

- We will pair up with devs who have complimentary strengths and weaknesses in order to teach each other.

- Cameron Walden: Organization & Technical Proficiency

- Marquesa Asmussen: Craft Competency & Planning & Estimating

- Steve Ngo: Craft & Quality Competencies

- Katy Roffe: Craft, Quality Competencies, Analytical Thinking & Problem Solving

- Eddie Ponce: Analysis/Problem Solving & Planning & Organizing

- Daily morning stand-ups
- Set daily goals & assigning tasks at start-of-day
- Midday check-ins to updateon current progress

## Conflict Plan

_Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary._

Describe at least:

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict when it arises?**

- Start by reaching out directly via Slack to address the issue
- If ineffective, bring it to the group
- Identify the conflict
- Call in leadership to help resolve if we're at an impasse

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

- Address with that individual 1-on-1
- Bring it to group if needed
- Escalate to Instructor team as last resort

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Maintain mutal respect and maturity
- address each other with kindness and patience
- At end-of-day/throughout day, do code-review to keep everyone apprsed of the function of each aspect
- Leave pseudo-code notes for each other to understand
- If lack of understanding of concepts becomes a serious obstacle to progress, contact instructor team for help in structuring project and delegation

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- Start by reaching out directly via Slack to address the issue
- If ineffective, bring it to the group
- Identify the conflict
- Call in leadership to help resolve if we're at an impasse

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- Call in leadership to help resolve if we're at an impasse

## Communication Plan

_Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up._

Describe at least:

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- 9am - 6pm committment at minimum

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

- Slack, Remo, Miro/Figma, Zoom, Discord(?)

**How often will you take breaks?**

- Regularly scheduled lunch @ noon if possible
- Extra breaks as needed (on the hour)

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- Start by assessing our MVP and what needs to stay and what can go
- If not significantly close to achieving MVP by Tuesday evening, call in reinforcements from JB & Sara

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- Everyone will respond promptly during promised work hours
- Can send a Slack message after hours and we will respond when available

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- At each meeting/crossroads, before leaving, go around the group and make sure each person has spoken.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- See above. Ensure that each team member has time to talk during meetings, don't speak over others, circle back to make sure everyone had their say.

## Work Plan

_Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts._

Describe at least:

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

- At morning stand-ups, divide up the day's required work into modules
- discuss where each team member would be most effective, as well as where they would liketo learn
- Use Basecamp to make to-do lists and assign tasks accordingly

**What project management tool will be used?**

- Basecamp & Miro/Figma(?)
  - we will give Figma a trial run and see how it works

## Git Process

_Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks._

Describe at least:

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

- Most up-to-date, functioning code

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

- We have a GitHub Org setup

**What is your Git flow?**

- make feature branches
- merge into a staging branch
- commit often
- wait to push until we are together
- set safety feature on GitHub to require team review for merge.
- make sure that all are aware of a new merge so we can all pull down current code

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

- Yes

  **How many people must review a PR?**

  - minimum 2 reviewers

  **Who merges PRs?**

  - whomever the second reviewer is (not creator of code)

  **How often will you merge?**

  - When a major change happens
  - When a feature is completed

  **How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**

  - We will only merge after confirming with full team
  - Likely will do merges during our scheduled team meetings
